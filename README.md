# My Dev Blog

Welcome to my personal blog built with **Next.js**!  

I write about **ideas, experiments, and learnings in public**—all powered by Markdown. Every time I push a new Markdown file, it automatically appears on the site.  

## Tech Stack
- **Next.js** – Fast, modern React framework.
- **Markdown** – Simple way to write and manage posts.
- **Deployed on Vercel** 

## Purpose
- Share my journey and projects publicly.
- Learn by doing and documenting.
- I really love low level programming and i want to document this journey if diving into it 

This website is vibe coded, but all posts will be written by me, no AI bullshit. This is my personal space to experiment, learn, and grow.
